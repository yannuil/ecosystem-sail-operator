# This file defines all the Istio versions supported by this operator.

# The list of versions to support. Each item specifies the name of the version,
# the Git repository and commit hash for retrieving the profiles, and
# a list of URLs for retrieving the charts.
# The first item in the list is the default version.
#
# IMPORTANT: in addition to the versions specified here, the versions of the
# istio.io/istio and istio.io/api dependencies defined in go.mod must also be
# updated to match the most recent version specified here. The versions in
# go.mod affect the generated API schema for the Sail CRDs (e.g. IstioRevision),
# as well as all the Istio CRDs (e.g. VirtualService).
